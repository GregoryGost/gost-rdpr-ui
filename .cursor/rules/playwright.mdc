- Workflow:
  1. browser_navigate to the page
  2. browser_wait_for need element
  3. browser_snapshot for accessible elements
  4. browser_take_screenshot to .cursor/artifacts
- Summarize console errors and network requests after each run.
- If there are errors, we make corrections until we correct the errors.

Always check the result in your browser.
